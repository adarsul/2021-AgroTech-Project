    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we used data collected by PM-WCS-3 Soil sensor and HX711 load cell using ESP32 in order to find change in soil moisture and weight to create a sensor based irrigation system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Automated Irrigation is very common in these days with everyone from hobby gardeners to commercial growers using some form of computer controlled irrigation. Most common systems are open loop systems where irrigation is applied at fixed time intervals. The next generation of automated irrigation are closed loop systems using data regarding parameters of soil, plant and environment to decide when to water and how much. In our project we made two closed loop systems of automatic irrigation based on two parameters - VWC and weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### VWC\n",
    "**Volumetric Water Content** is defined by ratio between the volume of water to the volume of wet material and in our context is refered to as soil moisture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\theta = \\frac{V_w}{V_{wet}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_w$ is the volume of water\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_{wet}$ is the total volume of wet matter represented as a sum of the volumes of solid, water and air. \n",
    "$$ V_{wet} = V_s + V_w + V_a $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weight\n",
    "The total weight of a potted plant is equivalent to the weight of the plant, soil, pot and water. Assuming that weight of soil and the pot do not change we can attribute all changes in weight to water irrigation and consumption and plant growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m_{total} = m_{constant} + m_w + m_{plant} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine plant growth in mass we will use measured amounts of water. Whenever the maximum weight of the plant is greater than the last maximum weight the difference is attributed to gain in plant matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Growth = m_{max2} - m_{max1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our goals:\n",
    "* Soil moisture irrigation:\n",
    "A system that starts watering when VWC goes under a certain threshold and stops when desired VWC is reached.\n",
    "* Irrigation by weight:\n",
    "A system that irrigates when the total weight goes under a certain threshold representing the loss of water. The system keeps record of the maximum weight everytime it is reached, updates plant growth in mass and threshold weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cloud Data Collection\n",
    "In order to collect data we have used Thingspeak IoT platform, allowing a sample rate of 1 reading every 15 seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interval Watering\n",
    "For interval watering we decided to use the ESP32 ability to connect to the internet to use NTP protocol - allowing clock synchronization. This way the watering is always in the same time of the day and takes daylight saving in consideration. Clock synchronizaion also keeps the interval steady also if the systems fails or restarts. Besides from opening and closing times there was no additionaly gathered data for this system. To trigger watering User picks watering time and for how long watering will occur using a loop count (in 15 seconds increments)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this test the plant was a sugar cane trigger time was 7:00AM and watering was set to 15 minutes which amounts to 1 liter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For seperate code and technical info:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Soil Moisture Sensor\n",
    "A PM-WCS-3 soil sensor was used to track soil moisture. The instrument tracks EC, E25, Soil Temp and VWC. For our test we have collected data for soil temperature and VWC as a representation of soil moisture. User decides a minimum soil moisture value to trigger irrigation and a maximum value to halt irrigation. Samples are taken every second and trigger is checked every 15 seconds and sent to the cloud as well. Using a loop count we also incorporated a maximum length for watering to avoid flooding, therefore once watering is triggered it keeps going until the maximum moisture value is reached or the loop count reaches it's limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this test the plant was a common reed, minimum moisture and maximum moisture were 60% and 90% respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For seperate code and technical info:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scale \n",
    "For the weight controlled irrigation we used the HX711 20 kg loadcell. The intsrument converts force to electrical output values. In order to recieves weight values in grams calibration was needed. Using standard weights and a digital kitchen scale we took average readings for the weights on the kitchen scale and on the HX711 and created a linear regression to generate readings in grams. \n",
    "\n",
    "The user decides on minimum weight to trigger watering and maximum weight that refers to the weight of the pot after watering. Due to the tendency of values to flunctuate a sample is taken every second and a reading is generated every 15 seconds from an average of 15 samples. Watering duration is set by a loop counter in 15 seconds increments. When minimum weight is reached watering is activated for set amount of time. Assuming that all weight gain during watering is due to water, if current weight is greater than last maximum value then the difference is attributed to plant growth. The difference is added to the minimum weight and the maximum weight and to a growth tracker. Readings are sent to to cloud every 15 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this test the plant was an eggplant, minimum weight and maximum weight were 3000 and 3750 grams respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For seperate code and technical info:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unified System\n",
    "In order to run 3 systems at once using the hardware we created a hybrid code that allowed all 3 systems to be connected to one ESP32 device. Codes for the 3 systems were modified and united in order to allow all triggers, watering and reading to happen simultaneously. For weight irrigation the sample rate was reduced resulting in lesser accuracy and for interval and moisture irrigation trigger checking was set to every 15 seconds. Data that was sent to the cloud by this system contained: weight for scale irrigation, VWC and soil temperature for moisture irrigation and on/off times for all 3.\n",
