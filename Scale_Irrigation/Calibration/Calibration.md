# Scale Calibration

When we started getting readings from the HX711 they were in seemingly arbitrary units. In order to convert these readings to usable values in grams we used a linear regression:

$$ y_{grams} = \alpha * x_{reading} + \beta $$

Using standardized weights and this code we produced 5 readings every second for 10 minutes. We copied our results to excel and organized in a table:




```python
