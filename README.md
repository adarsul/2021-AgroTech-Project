# AgroTech Lab 

## Gabriel and Adar's Project

This is our project in the AgroTech course in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Facutlty of Agriculture.
In this course we have used the Arduino platform using esp32 and a variety of sensors to build live, applicable agricultural data instruments. 

In this project our mission was to 3 different watering systems using the esp32:
1. Time Interval:
An open loop system that waters the plants at fixed times.

2. Moisture Controlled:
A closed loop system where data of soil moisture is collected by PM-WCS-3 Soil sensor to determine watering.

3. Weight Controlled:
A closed loop system where data of the plants weight is monitored by HX711 load cell scale. Watering is set by minimum and maximum values that are updated automatically to compensate for plant growth.

4. The unified version combining the 3 methods to one code (used on our report)
